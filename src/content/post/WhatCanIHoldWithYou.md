What can I hold you with?

还能用什么留住你呢？

I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs.

我予你枯寂的街道，失落的黄昏，和残缺的月。

I offer you the bitterness of a man who has lookedlong and long at the lonely moon.

我予你我那脉脉渴望孤月的苦涩。

I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts
that living men have honoured in bronze:

我予你我逝去的先祖，他的灵魂被后人以石碑铭记。

my father's father killed in the frontier of
Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs, bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in
the hide of a cow;

我祖父战死在布宜诺斯艾利斯的边境，两颗子弹穿过他的肺。他蓄着胡子死了，他的尸体被士兵用牛皮包裹；

my mother's grandfather
--just twentyfour-- heading a charge of
three hundred men in Peru, now ghosts on
vanished horses.

我的外祖父，那时只有24岁，在秘鲁率领三百将士冲锋陷阵，如今灵魂消失于萧萧马鸣间。

I offer you whatever insight my books may hold,
whatever manliness or humour my life.

我予你我的书中所有的深刻洞见，我生命中所有的刚毅坚卓和幽默风趣。

I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never
been loyal.

我予你我的全然的忠诚纵使我从未获得。

I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved,
somehow --the central heart that deals not
in words, traffics not with dreams, and is
untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.

我予你我所尽力存留的最柔软的内心。不知为何，这内心无法以言语表达，从未被时间，被欢乐，或被苦难染指。

I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at
sunset, years before you were born.

我予你落日下玫瑰上余晖的记忆，那时是你还未出生的遥远年岁。

I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about
yourself, authentic and surprising news of
yourself.

我予你你的表达，你的理论，你的真实而令人惊奇的消息。

I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the
hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you
with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.

我可以给你我的孤独，我的黑暗，我内心的饥渴；我试图用困惑，用危险和挫败来打动你。

- Jorge Luis Borges
